update 
all of the pages zoom out very nicely except for the home page 

maybe try to implement the same css on the homepage, 
	to see what i mean,
	zoom out really far on the home page 
	and the banner image doesn't scale to the center 
this only happens on the homepage

would be cool to add a js function which allows people to send 
a message to admin
then we could read/approve the messae and post it later
to a message board

post meeting agendas to club website
and current events 
and meeting minutes
